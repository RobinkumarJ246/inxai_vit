## Project: Conversational AI powered SmartHome Automation

### Short Description
Our project aims to provide an offline SmartHome automation solution using a light weight conversational LLM model trained using T5 architecture with an user friendly android app. We use Matter over MQTT for the communication. The model is embedded in the MQTT broker and the clients use publish-subscribe to use topics for the communication. We use a classification model to predict the parameters which are needed to be sent to the clients.

**Note:** Due to GitHub's file size limit (50 MB), we cannot upload the LLM models required for our project.
